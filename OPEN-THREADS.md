Derived from the project audit of 2026-10-25 (Satsang section), updated the same day. Status: **NS** not started ·
**P** partial · **B** blocked · **AU** awaiting the owner · **IP** in progress · **done**. Close a line by moving it to
"Closed" with the date.

| # | Thread | Status | Next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| S2 | Sit player → main site Practise tab ("Sit with it (hands-off)") | **AU** | Owner says yes/no; if yes follow specs/SIT-PLAYER.md §6 (iframe or same-origin, `satsang-sit-end` logging). |
| S5 | PLACES-REVIEW decisions (Rigpa, ZCLA, Sivananda, Himalayan Inst., Shambhala, Satyananda, Triratna, Kripalu, SYDA, Española, SFZC, Kabbalah Centre, NKT, Monte Sahaja) | **AU** | Owner decides keep / annotate / drop per row. Section C (Diamond Way, Osho, Amma, Isha, Dhammakaya) needs sourcing first. |
| S6 | Captions for passages / jump-to-moment | **B** | YouTube blocks the sandbox and GitHub runners. Only route: owner's machine runs yt-dlp → private satsang-data (needs OK). |
| S7 | Passage embeddings 1,472 / 8,165 | P | `embed.py passages 90` loop (local, free), pack, eval. Low value until captions exist. |
| S8 | Why-lines for gold/strong talks | NS | One line per gold/strong clip; re-ingest. Cheapest search-quality win. |
| S10 | Rob Burbea: profile with 0 talks | NS | Source official talks (Dharma Seed / Hermes Amāra) as full talks + virtual clips. |
| S11 | Two lecture links without licence-registry entries | not verified | Run `app/tools/licence_gate.py` over all resource URLs; add evidence or hold. |
| S12 | Pa-Auk "Dependent Origination: Previous Lives" (unofficial upload only) | B | Find an official copy or leave out. |
| S13 | Next Series: consciousness transference (phowa) via SERIES-FORMULA | **AU** | Owner says go. |
| S14 | Domain switch to satsang.digital | **AU** | Owner sets Porkbun nameservers to Cloudflare, then `app/tools/switch-domain.sh`. |
| S15 | Google OAuth (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID empty; claim-device untested live) | **AU** | Owner creates a Google client ID. |
| S16 | Crowd tally | P (code done 2026-10-25) | Anon votes + resonates now count (down-weighted); watch real volume; the cron (02:17 +07) fires (clip_stats `_job` row). |
| S17 | Atlas timeline / knowledge graph | P (prototype) | Decide: ship as a Traditions timeline view or park. |
| S18 | User curations / essays (ROADMAP 14) | NS | Needs moderation design + sign-in; park. |
| S19 | Topic review queues + LLM labelling (ROADMAP 13) | NS | Needs spend approval. |
| S20 | Visualisation cycles with deitybody (ROADMAP 15) | NS | Fold into /sit/ routines. |
| S21 | Gather phase 1 (ROADMAP 16) | NS | Park. |
| S22 | Qwen key (chat prose, realtime voice in /talk/) | **AU** | Key + spend approval from the owner; stays off. |
| S23 | Voice approval (Phonon Everly / Fish voice) | **AU** | Owner listens once. |
| S24 | More VBT / text → practice pipelines (Expand the Room, Catch the Gap, Sivananda pranayama, MN 10) | NS | Build as /sit/ pipelines. |
| S25 | Engine preview Worker near the 3 MB Free cap | risk | Move renders to R2/KV before adding more. |
| S26 | Teacher-page topic MMR; routines UI | NS | Routines UI folds into S2. |
| S27 | PLACES-TODO coverage + data quality | NS | Standing list in specs/PLACES-TODO.md; work top-down. Includes re-checking the 9 `details_unverified` places (PLACES-REVIEW D). |
| S30 | Discovery-batch flags (SES schools, Integral Yoga) | **AU** | Owner decides keep / annotate / drop (specs/PLACES-REVIEW.md section D); both are on the map with a place-level safety record. |
| S31 | No favicon: /favicon.svg 404s (static /place pages link it; index.html has none) | NS | Add a favicon to site/ (crawl flags it on static pages). |
| S32 | Enquiry lens index predates the 78 new places | NS | `sh deploy.sh search` if the lens should list them (lens held list now reads person red flags only). |
| S33 | Sivananda *Kundalini Yoga* (DLS) source map: passes 0–2 done read-only (189 sections, 23 runnable candidates, 59 rules; text private in satsang-data) | **AU** | Owner/teacher reviews `engine/sources/books/sivananda-kundalini-yoga/labels.tsv` tiers + REPORT.md conflicts, then pass 3 (first batch: sukha purvaka, nadi suddhi, bhastrika, suryabheda, ujjayi, bandhas, kapalabhati). Nothing compiled or deployed. |
| S28 | "USER TODO: public repo wiser-open for mcp/" | probably moot | prx0r/satsang is public: confirm, drop, add `repository` to the discovery card. |
| S29 | Held claims (Sucitto / Kornfield / Ramdev roles, 21 medium teacher_of edges, 28 held texts) | P | Verification pass with sources. |

## Security (cross-project, owner action)
- Rotate the R2 key that sits in public prx0r/characters HEAD (Funnier); revoke the GitHub PAT pasted in chat and save a new one in the vault.
